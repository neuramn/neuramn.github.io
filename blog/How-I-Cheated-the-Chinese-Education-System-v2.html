Days went by rather uneventfully, until the first day of grade 3, when mom thought it would be a great idea for me to carry the tuition to school myself. I got to school and handed the envelope full of money to the teacher, and started to wonder why I haven’t seen any other kids do the same. Later that day I found out that it was because, among the 800 kids in my school, I was the sole student paying tuition.</p><p name="835d" id="835d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn’t understand that because my parents had moved from different cities to Shenzhen, my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">household registration</a> was ‘temporary’ instead of ‘permanent’, that public schools charged students with temporary household registration extremely high amount of tuitions while local students paid practically nothing, or that such policies were designed to prevent large population flow by discouraging students from moving to new cities.</p><p name="5f42" id="5f42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hey, I was 9.</p><p name="31d1" id="31d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I understood that I was paying more, and that it’s unfair.

My parents were fully supportive. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Surprise</em>. So I studied as much as I could throughout the summer.</p><figure name="1742" id="1742" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 323px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 64.60000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*dq2bY_nPqkf3Ts77uUuysw.png" data-width="500" data-height="323" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dq2bY_nPqkf3Ts77uUuysw.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">rich kids’ private school</figcaption></figure><p name="e536" id="e536" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We didn’t know at the time, however, that every school had one unanimous, implicit rule: no skipping grades. After getting rejected by 5 schools and shut down in the face by the head of Department of Education of the city, I was on the verge of giving up. I put my last bit of hope on a private school 2 hours away from home.</p><p name="d13c" id="d13c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They simply said, no.</p><p name="aef7" id="aef7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There were, however, exams for transferring students happening on the very same day. I sneaked into one of them, naively thinking that since I already came all this far, if I can pass this test I could show it off to my friends. Only when I got into the exam room did I realize that there were students from different grades sat together and given exams in one single classroom. So I found a seat, sat down, calmly put down my name on the exam sheet and checked off the option “Transfer from grade 5 to grade 6”</p><p name="1091" id="1091" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">2 weeks later, phone rang; I passed. Apparently, they didn’t do any background checks on these kids.</p></div></div></section><section name="8d61" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="ed44" id="ed44" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading"><span class="graf-dropCap">A</span>nother 3 years later, I was at the end of the middle school era(9th grade for North America). Along with the 16800 <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">highly competitive</em> students in Shenzhen, I had to take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_High_School_Entrance_Examination" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_High_School_Entrance_Examination" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zhongkao</a>, the Chinese Senior High School Entrance Examination. To get into high school, one would need to compete with every single student from the same city to get into their desired high schools. It’s like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_School_Admission_Test" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_School_Admission_Test" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SSAT</a> from the states, but with more tears and blood.</p><p name="e361" id="e361" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I applied to only 2 schools: the best high school in Shenzhen in the past 10 years, and a college that accepted middle school students. The concept of college isn’t quite the same in China as it is in North America. One generally goes to college to study only the technical aspects of a specialized job. Therefore, most students would rather go to the worst high school instead of a college. My marks weren’t good enough for the big shot high school so I ended up going to the college — I made this decision under a whole lot of pressure, since going to colleges instead of high schools was considered devastating to one’s education. According to them:</p><blockquote name="e2b2" id="e2b2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">going to college means you can’t go to high school</blockquote><blockquote name="13a7" id="13a7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">not going to high school means you can’t go to university</blockquote><blockquote name="c59e" id="c59e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">not going to university means you are uneducated, therefore earning no respect</blockquote><p name="86d2" id="86d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I made my decision public; a lot of friends sent their condolences; teachers tried to help me find alternatives; and parents, well, they said nothing for a long time. Everyone tried their best to help me avoid this.</p><p name="f920" id="f920" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think it was one of the best things that ever happened to me.</p><p name="ecea" id="ecea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The college was 5 hours away from home, located right next to the seashore, surrounded by a few gorgeous beaches and small <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ancient </em>villages. I studied Graphic Design and Animations, so for the first 8 months, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, I draw and paint. Nothing else. It was quite meditating and peaceful; so much so that I would give anything to find that peace again in life. It was a perfectly timely buffer after all the stress brought by Zhongkao.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow" data-paragraph-count="2"><figure name="7257" id="7257" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--p" style="width: 48.066%;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Awk8jt0iPVRFFo-7.jpg" data-width="776" data-height="512" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*Awk8jt0iPVRFFo-7.jpg"></div></figure><figure name="4b1c" id="4b1c" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure" style="width: 51.934%;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 61.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*oVwf79UNKGb46FV7dUChbQ.png" data-width="1816" data-height="1109" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*oVwf79UNKGb46FV7dUChbQ.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption" style="width: 192.552%; left: -92.552%;">old town and beautiful sunset</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="3dde" id="3dde" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">So while all my friends were busting their brains out for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Higher_Education_Entrance_Examination" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Higher_Education_Entrance_Examination" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gaokao</a>, the Chinese equivalent of SAT, I was living like a hipster god; I would carry my drawing board out to either the beach or a corner of the village, rain or shine, and start drawing.
